Short paragraph about you (Each member of the group)
Luke: The team leader of this project is Luke Murdock and he is a student at UCAS, currently taking a programming class and creating projects like this one to help him learn python and the basics of programming. He mostly enjoys coding, expecially when it doesn't have many bugs and has a fun end product. He enjoys lots of other things including reading and playing games, including video games. He thinks it would be fun to eventually make some sort of actual game in the future if he ever gets the oppurtunity.

Alishya: The Senior Programmer of this project is Alishya Xavier. She is a freshman in highschool at Utah County Academy of Sciences. She has been taking program classes starting in middleschool to be able to learn python and enjoy using it. Some other things she enjoy doing are baking, spending time with her friends, and playing volleyball. At the moment she is trying multiple different things in highschool to be able to be open minded and enjoy every moment in whatever she decides in her future.
