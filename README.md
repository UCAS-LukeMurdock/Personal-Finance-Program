# Personal Finance Program

## Project Description
---
The purpose of the Personal Finance Tracker is to help users manage their income, expenses, and savings goals. This project lets the user make an account and saves all of their personal data that was used to manage their personal finances into a seperate file. Then after being logged in it can manage your savings goals by creating new ones, adding money into the savings, or seeing the progress made on that goal. It can also budget by making limits for the users expenses and lastly it can manage the users income and expenses by adding entries or visualizing the users data with a pie chart or a line graph. All of these things were made to make personal finances easy to manage.

## Execution and Usage
---
To use this program you will have to run the main file's code with having the other files connected to it. The program will play in the terminal and starts with a concise description of the program. It then lets you either sign in and use the program if you already have an account, sign up if you want to create an account or quit if you want to end the program. You then input a number that corresponds to the option you choose. If you input it incorrectly, you will recieve an error message and then you can reinsert your input.It will then ask if you want to track money entries, budget, manage savings goals, convert one currenct into another, or log out. By selecting the option you choose using the method mentioned above, it will bring you to that tool and you will be able to follow its instructions to use it. After you are finished with that option you will be brought to the menu option again to decide what else you want to do. When you are done with the program you can log out and then quit the program. The program uses a file to keep track of entries and goals so you can come back to the project and view or change them later.

Short paragraph about you (Each member of the group)
Luke: The team leader of this project is Luke Murdock and he is a student at UCAS, currently taking a programming class and creating projects like this one to help him learn python and the basics of programming. He mostly enjoys coding, expecially when it doesn't have many bugs and has a fun end product. He enjoys lots of other things including reading and playing games, including video games. He thinks it would be fun to eventually make some sort of actual game in the future if he ever gets the oppurtunity.

Alishya: The Senior Programmer of this project is Alishya Xavier. She is a freshman in highschool at Utah County Academy of Sciences. She has been taking program classes starting in middleschool to be able to learn python and enjoy using it. Some other things she enjoy doing are baking, spending time with her friends, and playing volleyball. At the moment she is trying multiple different things in highschool to be able to be open minded and enjoy every moment in whatever she decides in her future.

Alec: The UX/UI designer is Alec George. He is a student at UCAS, in the CS 1400 class. He's done a lot of programming in the past, and learned the basics of python over the summer before this released. This class has increased his knowledge of the subject a lot, something he likes doing. Alec enjoys programming, gaming, reading, mathematics, and learning in general. He probably made you lose the game by reading this last part.
